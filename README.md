## Introduction

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provides extensive data on healthcare services, charges, and payments in the United States. This analysis focuses on inpatient provider charge data from 2018 to 2022. The goal is to uncover trends, identify key cost drivers, and highlight variations across states and hospitals. Understanding these patterns can inform policy decisions, improve cost management, and enhance healthcare delivery.

The key objectives of the analysis include the following:
- Determine the total charges, Medicare payments, and total payments across the USA and each state from 2018 to 2022
- Identify which DRGs incur the highest Medicare costs
- Discover the most common hospital discharges and their trends over the years
- Examine the trends in charges, payments, and discharges over the last three years
- Identify states and hospitals with the highest charges and payments
